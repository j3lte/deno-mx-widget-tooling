## Installation

### Using Deno

If you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed, you can run the following command:
<!-- START INSTALL -->

```bash
deno install -A -n mx-widget-tooling https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j3lte/deno-mx-widget-tooling/0.5.1/cli.ts
```

<!-- END INSTALL -->
### Executable

> Note: This is not recommended, as updating does not work automatically.

You can download the latest executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/j3lte/deno-mx-widget-tooling/releases). Download the binary for your platform and place it somewhere in your path. Make sure it is executable (`chmod +x mx-widget-tooling`). You can now run `mx-widget-tooling` from anywhere.
