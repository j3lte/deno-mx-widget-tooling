MX Widget Tooling
====

Some tools I use for Mendix widget building. Conveniently wrapped in a Deno script that can be directly run from Github.

> This is intended for the power-users and should be used with caution. I do not take any responsibility for damaging you widget, computer or causing a global meltdown.

I use an alias for this in my `.bashrc`:

```bash
alias mx-widget-tooling="deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j3lte/deno-mx-widget-tooling/main/cli.ts"
alias mx-widget-tooling-reload="deno run --reload -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j3lte/deno-mx-widget-tooling/main/cli.ts"
```
